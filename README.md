Introduction
Predicting gender based on names can be useful in various applications such as marketing, personalization, and demographic analysis. This project uses an Excel-based approach to predict gender by analyzing the last letter of names.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in the Gender Predictor.xlsx file. It contains two columns:

Name: The name of the person.
Gender: The gender of the person (Male/Female).

Methodology
The project uses a pivot table in Excel to analyze the last letter of each name and its corresponding gender. By examining the frequency of genders associated with each last letter, the model predicts the gender of a new name based on its last letter.

Steps:
Data Preparation: Clean and format the dataset.
Pivot Table Creation: Create a pivot table to count the occurrences of each gender for each last letter of names.
Gender Prediction: Use the pivot table to predict the gender of a new name based on the last letter of the name.
Usage
Open the Gender Predictor.xlsx file in Excel.
Navigate to the pivot table that analyzes the last letters of names and their corresponding genders.
To predict the gender of a new name, write the name and copy paste the already placed formula in corresponding cell.

Results
The performance of the gender prediction is based on the accuracy of the pivot table analysis. Detailed results and evaluation metrics can be viewed directly within the Excel file.
