# Gender-Prediction-by-their-Name
This project uses an Excel-based approach to predict the gender of a person based on the last letter of their name. By leveraging a pivot table, the project analyzes the frequency of genders associated with each last letter and uses this analysis to make predictions. The prediction is entirely based on data analysis within Excel.
